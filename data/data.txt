The datasets used for test cases are too large for Github, therefore they are provided with the following link:
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AuYkVS2by4myhe1r_TUO1fe0ncP7kA?e=xPprIV
They should be placed in this */data* folder under the corresponding test case name. There is a zipped version of all four test cases, but the cases are also available for download separately.
If you have any issue accessing the data files please contact: hunor.csala@sci.utah.edu
